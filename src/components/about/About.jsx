          Hi there! üëãüèª I'm Rui, an aspiring software enginner that loves solving problems in math and code. I fell in love with programming not only because I love to innovate and challenge myself, but also, I love to learn about other people's thought processes and how they would tackle a problem. Outside of programming, I love to draw, listen to music, and explore new things. I'm always open to connect and chat!
